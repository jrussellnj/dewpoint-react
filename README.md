# Dewpoint Forecast
### Answering the question: "Is it gross outside right now?"

https://dewpoint.xyz

According to the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/arx/why_dewpoint_vs_humidity), the dew point is

> the temperature the air needs to be cooled to in order to achieve a relative humidity (RH) of 100%. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the amount of moisture in the air. This directly affects how "comfortable" it will feel outside. So if you want a real judge of just how "dry" or "humid" it will feel outside, look at the dew point instead of the RH. The higher the dew point, the muggier it will feel.

People may be mislead by the humidity value outside when they are trying to figure out if it's muggy or not, but the dew point value is really the value to look at. With [Dewpoint Forecast](https://dewpoint.xyz), people can quickly view color-coded current and forecasted dew point values to gauge how muggy or dry it is outside.
